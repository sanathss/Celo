Application for downloading and presenting random users

The following application was developed within 3 days to meet the following requirements
* Extract random user information from REST API
* Display information on users
* Implementation of pagination
* Filter/Search
* SQLite DB operations
* Detailed view

The application should meet each of these requirements.

Incomplete components due to time restriction
* Unit and UI testing
* UI design principles (information is presented in a bland way)
* No offline downloading of images
* ORM such as Room Persistence Library not implemented which would have helped in designing for MVP pattern
* Keys on database
